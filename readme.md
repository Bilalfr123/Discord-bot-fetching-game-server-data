It updates your bot status periodically with players of server. If you own some game server such as rust or the isle, use the bot to show real time server data on your bot.

## Installation

Refer to my general guide on how to run the bot [here](https://github.com/bilal-the-dev/How-to-run-my-discord-bots)

If you still face any problem, please open a issue.
